**Welcome to the Reflex Rangers Code and How to Guide**

Reflex Rangers is my take on the Lab 6 Reflex Game project choice. It consists of 3 levels all that will test your reflexes and then show you your results at the end. This project proved to be a challenging task as just the Gamer_Driver.c alone has 1000 lines most of which are just to produce text on the screen. Before going into an in depth how to and spotlight of important functions within this code, if you look below you will se the coding heiarchy:

As you can see in the diagram a majority of everything is run through the Game Driver into the Application Code. This was done so that the levels which are individual functions would not have to be made in the application but rather in the Game Driver and then run through the application code. Everything was ran through the Gamer Driver in the end except for the LED Driver file set which I did not even end up utilizing.

**Important Functions**

The functions that were most essential to my game are in the Gamer Driver, RNG Driver, and LCD Driver. The first one of note is in the RNG Driver fileset and this is the RNG_Get function which is key to the game as this function allows for the randomness of each level individual task. Whether that be producing either a square and triangle in the first level or randomly picking one of the four squares to change into a triangle in the second level. This function is essential to the gameplay and difference of every run through of the game. The function initializes the RNG peripheral, gets a number using the built in RNG HAL functions, sets this return value to a local variable in the function, deinitializes the RNG peripheral and then returns the local variable as this is the random number. The reason for initializing and then re initializing the peripheral all within the same function was because this was the only way I was able to get this to work consistently. 

The next two functions key to the game are similar as they both draw two shapes, that being the LCD_Draw_Triangle_Fill and LCD_Draw_Square_Fill functions. These two functions draw shapes essential to the first two levels, the square one works by filling in pixels row after row given the length of one side. The Triangle draw functions works by drawing a triangle from bottom up by using the length parameter of the function drawing that as the base and then subtracting two off this value and moving the next line draw start value up one x value and one y value. It keeps repeating this pattern and drawing of layers until the original length parameter reaches 0. 

The next three most important functions were in the Game_Driver.c and it was the levels themselves. Each level shows a description of its task delayed by 5 seconds and then it starts its level activity and then moves you to the next level. I found it easiest to have each level call the next one at the end of its function as this was like a waterfall of sorts which just moves onto the next thing and it made it really easy to loop back to the start when at the end of the game. All of these levels use the Button Interrupt to interact with each activity and to complete each task. Overall without these there would not be a Game (obviously). The last two functions essential to the game can be found at the bottom of the Game_Driver.c and this is the End_Screen function. This function shows the player their scores by using static variables that capture each level's time to completion and a different helper function that allows the program to get each individual digit of the static variable so that they can be printed on the LCD screen. 

**Game How To**When starting the game you will see the title screen and a description of the game, you will be prompted to press the button to start the game and move onto Level 1 (also referred to as the green level). 

**Level 1:**
You will see a fast description of the level, basically either a square or triangle will appear on the screen, and as soon as one of those shapes appears as fast as you can press the button and this will test your reaction time to seeing something appear quickly. You will then see a message telling you good job and that the game is moving on to level 2.

**Level 2:**
Much like the last level you will see a fast description of the level, this level's layout is a grid of four squares one in each corner of the LCD screen. At a random time one of the four squares will transform into a triangle and as soon as this happens and you see it press the button as fast as you can. Kind of like the first this will test how fast you can press the button after noticing something change, although unlike the first it is a little more subtle and therefore can be harder. You will then see a message telling you good job and that the game is moving on to level 3.

**Level 3:**
This is the last level of the game, the first thing you will see is a fast description of the level. This level shows a white circle bouncing back and forth on a red screen with a black center line in the middle. As soon as the entire circle has crossed the centerline, meaning the back edge of the circle is on the line, the circle will stop and then at this time you must quickly press the button. On this level you have three attempts and your final score for the level will be the best(fastest) of these three attempts. The number in the middle of the circle denotes which attempt you are on. You will then see a message telling you good job and that the game is moving on to the final screen which is where you will see your times from each level.

The last screen will show you each time from each level Green(Level 1), Yellow(Level 2), and Red(Level 3). It will also prompt you to press the button if you would like to play again, pressing the button will immediately restart the game and take you back to the Level 1 description and then activity. All in all this game is concise and straightforward and very user and newbie friendly due to the adequate descriptions before each level. I felt this made the game more fun and my friends who tested it like this fact as well.
